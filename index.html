									<p><strong>Yup, Its just the two of us, Aryaman Agrawal (left) and Padam Chopra (right). The first thing that we worked on together was DECA Idea Challenge, for which we became the <a href="https://www.decadirect.org/2017/01/30/deca-idea-challenge-2016-global-winners-announced/" target="blank">Global Winners</a>. While we were celebrating for it, we came up with the idea of starting Practikality and even since then, we've "never looked back". Practikality has been to a lot of places and we've made it big by going to IRIS, NITI Aayog and even getting selected as one of the Top 100 innovations in India under the ATL Mission. Our apps have been featured at a lot of places</strong></p>
